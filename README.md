<h1>AI-Classification-Experiement</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a course assignment for my bachelors degree where we looked at and compared the difference to a large collection of AI classification alogirthms

<h4>What I Learnt</h4>
This project taught me so much about how basic 2D games function. I covered game loops, collision and movement. As well as this was my first time using classes and how they work. This also taught me the basics of reading from a external file via the saving mechanic.
