<h1>AI-Classification-Experiement</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a course assignment for my bachelors degree where we looked at and compared the difference to a large collection of AI classification alogirthms

<h4>What I Learnt</h4>
This project taught me a lot on different types of classification algorithms and the time cost behind each and there accuracy and how each compares to the other interms of accuracy
</p>

<h2>Classification Alogirthms Covered</h2>
<p> - K Nearest Neighbor</p>
<p> - Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier</p>
<p> - Logistic Regression</p>
<p> - Decision Tree</p>
<p> - Gradient Boosting</p>
<p> - Random Forest</p>
<p> - MLP Classifier</p>
